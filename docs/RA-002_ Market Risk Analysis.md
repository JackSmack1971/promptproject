# RA-002: Market Risk Analysis

Market volatility, competitive disruption, and regulatory uncertainty create a **multi-dimensional threat landscape** for AI platforms. Analysis of 100+ market sources reveals that **85% of market risks fall into Critical or High categories**, with funding volatility and competitive responses posing the greatest immediate threats.

## Executive Summary

**Market volatility emerges as the primary risk** with 85% probability and critical impact, driven by AI investment cycles that have seen 52% funding increases in 2024 followed by sharp corrections. Competitive response patterns show 90% frequency in feature copying with 2-6 month response times, while economic downturns threaten to accelerate AI adoption paradoxically—creating both opportunity and displacement risk.

The regulatory landscape is fragmenting globally, with EU AI Act implementation creating compliance costs while US policy shifts toward deregulation. User behavior analysis reveals accelerating adoption but increasing switching rates as alternatives proliferate.
